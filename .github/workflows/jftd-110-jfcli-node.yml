      # 1. Go to your JFrog Platform instance
      # 2. Navigate to Administration -> General Management -> Manage Integrations -> New Integration -> OpenID Connect tab -> New Integration
      # 3. Select "Open ID Connect" in the drop-down menu
      # 4. Configure the OIDC provider with your settings
      # 5. Copy the "Show Snippet" YAML configuration

      # Purpose: This step serves as a validation and debugging step to confirm that
      # the OIDC authentication was successful and that the JFrog CLI setup step
      # properly generated an access token. It only runs when the setup-jfrog-cli
      # step successfully outputs an OIDC token, providing immediate feedback on
      # the authentication status before proceeding with subsequent operations.
      #
      # Why it's important: This step helps troubleshoot OIDC integration issues
      # early in the workflow and confirms that the JFrog CLI is properly configured
      # with valid credentials before attempting to use it for npm operations.

      #
      # Purpose: This step configures the npm registry to use JFrog Artifactory repositories
      # for both deployment and resolution. It sets up the npm configuration to point to
      # the virtual repository that combines local and remote npm repositories.
      #
      # Instructions:
      # 1. Ensure the JFrog CLI is properly configured (from Lab 1.1)
      # 2. Uncomment this step to enable npm registry configuration
      # 3. The step will configure npm to use the lab110-npm-virtual repository

      # (JFrog Advanced Security) to detect vulnerabilities, secrets, SAST issues,
      # and license compliance problems in the source code and dependencies.
      #
      # Instructions:

      # the build information and associates all downloaded packages with the build
      # for later analysis and compliance tracking.
      #
      # Instructions:
      # 1. Ensure npm registry is configured (from Lab 2.1)

      # from the GitHub Actions runner and associates it with the build for
      # complete traceability and debugging purposes.
